# DiscardBot
A basic Discord bot shell.

# Installation commands
You'll need to execute the following commands in the source directory to get this set up. The ordering is important.

* `npm install discord.io winston -save`
* `npm install https://github.com/woor/discord.io/tarball/gateway_v6`
* `npm install fs`
* `npm install path`

# Token
You'll also need to copy your Discord bot token to `token.txt` in the source directory.

# Running
After these are set up, you run the bot using `node bot.js` in a command prompt in the source directory. On Windows, you can stop the bot at any time by using CTRL + C in the prompt.
